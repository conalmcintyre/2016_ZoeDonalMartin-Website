			<p>	"Máirtín O'Connor is a squeeze box player in the very top echelon." Irish Music Magazine<br><br>
				"Virtuoso - one of Ireland's most gifted young musicians." The Irish Independent on Zoë Conway<br><br>
				"Donal Lunny. a man who has been at the coal face of Irish music for the past five decades." Hot Press<br><br>

				This new group brings together the dazzling talents of three of the country's finest traditional musicians; button accordion master Máirtín O'Connor, fiddle player Zoë Conway and guitar and bouzouki player Donal Lunny. Don't miss this illustrious trio in what promises to be an atmospheric and unforgettable tour, drawing on an eclectic mix of the old and new where traditional tunes and songs meet each of their diverse influences and unique compositional voices.<br>
				<br>
				The consummate button box player, Máirtín O'Connor was one of the driving forces behind the Riverdance phenomenon. Add to that his work with bands such as De Dannan, Midnight Well and Skylark, his reputation as a composer and solo artist, and recording sessions with Rod Stewart, Elvis Costello and Mark Knopfler, and it's easy to see why O'Connor is regarded in the folk firmament as something of a national treasure.<br><br>
				Fiddle player Zoë Conway is an awesome talent equally at home playing and singing Latin jazz with Rodrigo y Gabriella, as a guest soloist with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, performing with Lou Reed and Nick Cave, or touring the world with Riverdance. However, traditional Irish music remains close to her heart, witnessed in her highly-acclaimed solo albums.<br><br>
				Guitar and bouzouki player Donal Lunny needs no introduction, having made his name as a member of the hugely influential groups Planxty, The Bothy Band, Altan and Moving Hearts. A gifted composer, arranger and producer, Lunny has also worked with rock and pop musicians such as Van Morrison, Rod Stewart, Elvis Costello and Kate Bush.<br><br>
